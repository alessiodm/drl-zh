    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    " * No need to store action-values.\n",
    " * Ability to learn a stochastic policy direcly.\n",
    " * Hence, no need to manually tune exploitation vs. exploration.\n",
    " * Effective in continuous action spaces (and high-dimensional state spaces).\n",
    " * They generally have good convergence properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    " * They might have high-variance.\n",
    " * Might converge to a local maximum.\n",
    " * Slower than other methods, and might take a long time to train."
