    "## Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Future Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing to notice is that we are using all rewards at every timestep. But really, we should only\n",
    "consider future rewards: i.e., the rewards that are actually the consequences of our actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g = \\sum_t R_t^{future}\\nabla_{\\theta} log\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t | s_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collect Multiple Trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "In every episode, we sample a single trajectory: the gradient update might not contain good data\n",
    "about our policy and the stochastic updates might be very _noisy_. Learning happens because in the\n",
    "long run we hope that all tiny signals accumulate and converge towards the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we reduce noise? The simplest strategy is to collect more trajectories (with the current\n",
    "policy) at once! And Gymnasium vectorized environment `gym.vector.VectorEnv` serves exactly that\n",
    "purpose!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalize Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "When collecting multiple trajectories, a technique we can use is to normalize the rewards across the\n",
    "various trajectories: which roughly picks half actions to encourage / discourage, and keeps the\n",
    "gradient updates moderate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_k \\leftarrow \\frac{R_k - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rewards distribution will also likely change during training, and a reward that might be good at\n",
    "the beginning might actually signal a bad trajectory in late stages of training. Normalization helps\n",
    "with such cases as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to subtract to the reward a _baseline_ $b$, for example the average reward along all\n",
    "trajectories (What if every trajectory has _always_ positive returns?). In this case, things that\n",
    "are above average will push their probabilities to happen up while things below average will be\n",
    "penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - \\alpha \\sum_{t=0} \\nabla_{\\theta} \\log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t) [R(\\tau) - b(s_t)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this because on expectation this extra subtracted term will have zero effect (as long as\n",
    "it does not depend on the action in _logprob_), but overall we'll get reduced variance (proof left\n",
    "as exercise and/or you can find it in the resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This value that we multiply with the log-probability to \"reinforce\" or \"depress\" the corresponding\n",
    "actions is called the _advantage function_ and plays a critical role in state-of-the-art algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(*) = R(\\tau) - b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures how better the selected action does compared to the _average_ in the state.\n"
