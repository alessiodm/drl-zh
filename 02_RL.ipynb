    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning algorithms solve MDP-based control problems having the agent interact with\n",
    "the environment (i.e., sampling) and learning from its experience. In order to do so, the agent will\n",
    "try to maximize the expected return, or _expected cumulative reward_ (reward hypothesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, let's introduce some useful concepts. There are two types of RL tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Episodic:** The task has one or more end (or _terminal_) states. For example, our grid world\n",
    "   robot task ends either in the bomb or in the target.\n",
    " * **Continuous:** The task never ends, there are no terminal states. The agent keeps interacting\n",
    "   with the environment (e.g., stock trading agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are two main approaches for solving an RL problem:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Value-based:** The agent learns an optimal value function (e.g., $Q(s,a)$), and then derives\n",
    "   the optimal policy from it (see previous lecture). For now, we will focus on these methods.\n",
    " * **Policy-based:** The agent learns an optimal policy directly. We will learn about a popular\n",
    "   category of algorithms of this kind later on (i.e., _policy gradient_ methods)."
